## geojsonlocation add-on

geojsonlocation add-on based on the default location field included in Cockpit.

Modifications made:

- Leaflet and Algolia Places files are included in the assets folder and not loaded from unpkg (_speeds up loading of admin_).
- Leaflet and Algolia Places files are loaded on admin initialization, not when the field is shown (_if you have this addon, but don't use it, it still loads the assets_)
- Data is stored in the GeoJSON format.

Versions:

- Leaflet 1.7.1
- Algolia Places 1.19

You don't need to enter API keys for Algolia Places, it supports 1000 requests daily without key.

Algolia Precision is not great, it supports street level precision (4 decimals).
Google Places is more precise, but their license doesn't allow storing lat/lon data.
